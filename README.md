# ML_Final_Project
Final project on text analysis - Irfan Jamil (ijamil1), Ryan(rhubley1), and Matt (mkilgar1)

We have 2 notebooks that we used to find the results for our project. Both can be downloaded
and ran with the following datasets.

For the datasets, we used the reviews that were provided to us in the project guidlines document.
We also used a massive tweet dataset that we were unable to upload to this gitrepo, but it can
be accessed and downloaded at the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
In order to get these datasets to work with our code, you must make sure that they are located at
the root directory of wherever you downloaded the notebooks, and you must make sure to RENAME
the tweet dataset to sentiment140.csv
